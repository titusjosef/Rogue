<p> Rogue once started out as an idea that my brother and I had 20 years ago while creating one of our famous dishes "Green Glove Tamales". We both wanted to prove to the world that we could create our own family cooking business and become succesful at perfecting our crafts as cooks! We both worked as chefs at this resturant called "Rubio's"and we both saved up enough money to purchase our own food truck! We both worked hard to make sure we studied the in's and out's of how to properly manage a food truck business and honestly it was one of the best decisions we've ever made. Our dreams of having our own cooking business was finally coming true! Of course we started off slow but soon word spreaded around town and customers started rolling in like crazy! We than began to hire people within our famiily. Then after 2 years of running the business with my family we've then made enough money to open our first resturant!!! </p>
